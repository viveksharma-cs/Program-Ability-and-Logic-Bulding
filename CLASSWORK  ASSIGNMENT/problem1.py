# You are given an array of integers arr[]. You have to reverse the given array. 
# Note: Modify the array in place. 
# Examples: 
 
# Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5] 
# Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1] 
# Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the 
# array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the 
# second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].
