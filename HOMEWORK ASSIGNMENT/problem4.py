#  You are given two arrays a[] and b[], return the Union of both the arrays in any 
# order. 
# The Union of two arrays is a collection of all distinct elements present in either of 
# the arrays. If an element appears more than once in one or both arrays, it should be 
# included only once in the result. 
# Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct. 
# Note that, You can return the Union in any order but the driver code will print the 
# result in sorted order only. 
# Examples: 
# Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], b[] = [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2] 
# Output: [1, 2, 3] 
# Explanation: Union set of both the arrays will be 1, 2 and 3.
